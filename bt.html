         <h2><p>At a distance of 6 km from Bhavnagar Railway Station, Gaurishankar Lake is a manmade lake situated in the heart of Bhavnagar city. Locally known as Bor Talav, it is one of the picturesque lakes in Bhavnagar and among the must visit places during Bhavnagar Tour.</p></h2>
         <h2><p>Huge in size and colossal in beauty, Gaurishankhar Lake was built in 1872 under the guidance of Sri Gaurishankar Oza, the then Deewan of Bhavnagar. Situated on the edges of Victoria Park, the lake was spread over an area of 381 hectares. It was constructed as a reservoir to meet up water requirements of Bhavnagar citizens. Today, Gaurishankhar Lake is a famous picnic spot for the people of Bhavnagar.

            The planetarium called Kailash Vatika, around Bhavnagar Lake is a great attraction for children and a great way to introduce and educate them about astronomy. Bhav Vilas Palace located in the vicinity of the lake used to be the clubhouse of the royal family. Many official events were conducted here when Bhavnagar was a princely state. However, now this palace is the official residence of Maharajkumar Shivbhadrasinhji Krishnakumarsinhji Gohil & his family. The view of the lake from the palace is breathtaking. There is also a boat house where one can enjoy boating in the lake.
